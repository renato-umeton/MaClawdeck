/* SideCrab widget v0.30.0 — runtime, consuming /v1/state (schema 1–5) from crabd
   on loopback. docs/STATE-CONTRACT.md is authoritative; this file must not
   invent fields.

   THE VERSION ABOVE IS PROVENANCE, NOT A MACHINE-READ VALUE: manifest.json holds
   the only one anything reads. It is here, and in the CSS and the HTML, so a file
   in front of you says which release it belongs to — and a test asserts all four
   agree, because the whole value of a provenance tag is being swept together.

   VERSIONING (rework, v0.6.1): `schema` marks the last BREAKING shape, NOT the
   feature level. Every additive field — contextTokens, fleet, recap, byModel,
   events, daily — is found by FIELD PRESENCE and renders as its absent-behaviour
   when missing, so crabd may ship new fields under the same number and this
   widget simply lights them up when it is next imported. NOTHING in this file
   may gate behaviour on a schema NUMBER comparison; a number above the ceiling
   is a real break and stays a dead feed. The lesson that bought this: crabd
   redeploys over RDP, the widget does NOT — an .icuewidget import is a
   double-click at the iCUE console, so schema N+1 bricked the glass until
   someone stood at the desk.

   Budget: two timers (3 s poll, 1 Hz clock) and no requestAnimationFrame. Every
   DOM write goes through setText/setVar, which no-op when the value is unchanged,
   because this panel runs 24/7 on a desk display. */

   payload sent for that key, so a property event that changes nothing sends
   nothing.

   There is deliberately NO schema gate here. /v1/config is an ENDPOINT, and the

   null-or-object since crabd 0.2.0, but the endpoint only landed in 0.4.0 — so

   is an airtight signal for this endpoint. So the widget ATTEMPTS the POST and
   reads the reply — the only honest capability test there is.

   v0.7.0 added `toast` and v0.10.0 `budget`, and all three are sent as SEPARATE
   POSTs, never one body carrying several. That is the whole point of per-key
   handling: an older crabd 400s the key it does not know, and a combined body
   would take quiet hours down with it — one unsupported key silently disabling a

   The widget updates by console import while crabd updates by redeploy, so this

                  hint renders in. Reachable no other way off-glass, because
                  every other form of the flag manufactures ids.
   &sensornames=<cpu>|<gpu>  the names iCUE answers getSensorName with. Empty
                  segments mean a bridge that answers with nothing, which is the
                  no-label path.
   &sensorsame=1  BOTH properties resolve to one id — the operator's own defect,
                  reproduced rather than simulated: sensorIdFor returns the same
                  string for both keys, so every "are these the same sensor?"

	   every one of its neighbours:

	   - BELOW connecting / stale. Both of those mean the panel cannot see anything,

	     claiming a live opinion about a dead feed.
	   - BELOW quiet. Quiet hours is the operator saying "night mode", and the rule
	     everywhere else on this panel is that quiet clears everything — the glow, the
	     pulse, the tricks, the escalation. A crab sweating in a dark room is the
	     panel raising its voice in exactly the hours it was told not to. The gauge is
	     still red and still says so; the crab stops narrating it.
	   - BELOW waving. A session is waiting on a HUMAN. A limit is a fact about the
	     account and will still be true in five minutes; a question is the one thing
	     on this panel that is about the person standing in front of it.
	   - BELOW celebrating, and this one is the close call. Celebrating outranks it
	     because it is a TEN SECOND latch that clears itself, and sweating resumes the
	     moment it does — so nothing is lost. The other order loses the whole feature:
	     a red weekly window lasts hours, so sweating-over-celebrating would silently
	     delete every celebration on a busy estate, which is precisely when a
	     half-hour turn landing is worth marking.
	   - ABOVE the empty-grid asleep, deliberately. A window at 97% is true whether or

   exactly one mechanism for an iCUE HTML widget: every widget has a QUuid
   exposed as the global `uniqueId`, and ONE JSON object holding all of that
   widget's persisted properties is stored in localStorage under that id. So the
   pin map is a PROPERTY INSIDE that object (PIN_PROP), never a localStorage key
   of its own — a widget that scatters bare keys across the origin is sharing a
   namespace with every other widget iCUE serves from the same file:// origin.
   The doc also says display state only: no credentials, no personal data. A map
   of session ids the operator chose to keep at the front of their own panel is
   display state and nothing more.

   Feature-detected on both halves, because both can be absent:
     - `uniqueId` does not exist in a dev browser at all (it is injected by the
       iCUE host), and referencing an undeclared identifier is a ReferenceError,
       not undefined — which is why this goes through getIcueProperty.
     - localStorage itself THROWS on access in some locked-down profiles, so
       every call is wrapped rather than tested once for existence.

/* THE CLAMP, and the ONE thing it guarantees (v0.26.0, AUD-F5).

   The "+N more" tile is only acceptable while a WAITING card can never be the row
   it swallows — a panel that hides the question it exists to surface is worse than
   a panel with no grid at all. Measured at HEAD before this function existed: the
   widget held that invariant only by INHERITING it. sortPinned reads its bands out
   of the order crabd delivered (first appearance of each state) and is deliberately
   the identity with nothing pinned, the filter and the dismissals both preserve
   order, and the clamp was a bare slice — so every part of the widget was correct
   and the guarantee itself lived in another process. Feed the same code a document
   whose sessions are not pre-sorted (12 done rows, then one needs_input, capacity 8)
   and the waiting card lands in the "+N more" tail: proven by test, not argued.

   So the clamp keeps it now: waiting rows survive first, everything else fills what
   is left, and the ORDER is untouched in both lists. That is not a second copy of
   crabd's band list — it names ONE state, the one the panel is for — and it is the
   discipline recapLine already keeps two screens down ("crabd sorts commits count
   desc, but the max is taken here rather than trusting position").

   On any contract-conforming feed this is byte-for-byte the old slice, which is
   the point: 65 fingerprint captures, zero layout differences.

   With more waiting rows than cells, waiting rows ARE cut — there is no cell to put
   them in — and CD-14's tile is the route to them. What cannot happen is a waiting

   TWO SOURCES, SERVED ONE FIRST — and neither is a number this file made up.

   1. `contextWindowTokens` (crabd 0.28.0), found by PRESENCE like every other
      additive field. crabd resolves it from the status line document, the model
      marker, or the Models API's `max_input_tokens`, in that order, and serves null
      when none of the three knows. This is the branch the comment here used to
      promise: before it, the marker was the only source, and live model ids carry no
      marker (`claude-fable-5`, `claude-opus-5`), so NO bar ever drew on a real
      session.
   2. the `[1m]` / `[200k]` marker in the model id, for a crabd older than 0.28.0.
      Exactly the fallback it always was, so an un-upgraded companion keeps the bars
      it already drew — this widget is not redeployable on demand (see header).

   The order cannot be flipped. crabd already ranks the marker ABOVE its catalog, so
   a served number has either honoured the marker or come from something MORE
   specific than it; reading the marker first would discard the status line's own
   reading of the live session.

   There is still deliberately NO model-name table, on either side of the wire.
   "opus means 200k" would be a number no document ever said, and it is the kind of
   invention that goes wrong silently: the day a window changes, every card would
   report a fill against last year's denominator and nothing anywhere would say so.

/* ===================================================== touch gestures (v0.14.0)

   Four gestures on one pointer stream: swipe a done/idle card away, press and
   hold a card to pin it, tap with two fingers anywhere to acknowledge everything
   waiting, and pull down from the top edge to force a refresh.

   THE CLICK IS STILL THE TAP. Nothing below replaces the existing click handlers
   — a tap on a card opens its sheet through onCardsClick exactly as it did in
   v0.13.0, and every control in the sheet is still a click. What this layer adds
   is the ability to SWALLOW that click when a gesture has already consumed the
   interaction, which is done once, in the capture phase, on the document
   (onClickCapture): a per-handler guard would have to be added to every control
   the panel ever grows, and the one somebody forgot would be the one that fired
   a sheet open under a swiped card.

   Touch-first, and that is a design constraint rather than a preference: there is
   no hover on this glass, so no gesture may depend on one and none of them has a
   discoverability story that starts with a cursor. pointerdown/move/up are used
   rather than touch events so a mouse in a dev browser drives the same code path
   the fingertip does — which is what makes the gestures testable at all.
   The listeners are PASSIVE: nothing here calls preventDefault, because the
   axis each gesture wants is claimed declaratively in CSS (touch-action) where
   the compositor can honour it without waiting on a handler. */

/* WHAT THIS IS AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT.

   This panel ships on a wall-mounted TOUCHSCREEN with no keyboard attached, and
   inventing a full keyboard UX for a surface that cannot exercise one would be
   shipping a second interaction model nobody can test. But the store checklist
   carries an accessibility row, and every QA pass this widget has ever had —
   QtWebEngine or a browser — was driven from a machine that does have a keyboard,
   where the panel was a set of divs with click handlers: nothing reachable by
   Tab, nothing activatable by Enter, and a sheet that could be opened and then
   only closed with a pointer.

   So: the cheap, high-value subset, and no more.
     - Escape closes the sheet. One key, the one everybody already presses.
     - Tab is trapped inside an open sheet, and the panel behind it goes
       aria-hidden — a modal that leaks focus to the controls it is covering is
       worse than no focus management, because the operator ends up driving a
       button they cannot see.
     - Enter / Space activate anything already carrying role="button". Native
       <button> elements do this themselves, so they are excluded here rather
       than being clicked twice.

   v0.30.0 ADDED THE REST OF IT, because a panel with an address in a browser is
   driven from a keyboard by definition: `a` ack-all, `p` pin, Delete/Backspace
   dismiss, `r` refresh, `s` settings — each calling the same function its
   gesture calls, each narrating itself on the notice line, and each inert
   behind a modifier, an autorepeat, an open sheet or a focused input.

   Still deliberately skipped, and named so nobody has to re-derive why:
   arrow-key navigation of the card grid. Tab already reaches every card in
   order, so arrows would be a second traversal of the same set with its own
   wrap, edge and column rules to get wrong on a grid whose column count is a

   manifest has carried `interactive: true` since v0.2.0. Both of those are true at
   once only if SOMETHING arrives and something else does not. The spec's own words
   for what iCUE forwards are "widget click handling", which would make a tap a
   synthesized CLICK and leave every gesture on this panel — swipe, long press,
   two-finger tap, pull-to-refresh — reading an event stream that is not there.
   THAT IS A HYPOTHESIS AND NOBODY HAS MEASURED IT — do not build on the paragraph
   above. This is the instrument; a later wave rebuilds gestures on what it records.

   THE INSTRUMENT MUST NOT PERTURB THE THING IT MEASURES, and that is the whole
   design constraint. Every listener is installed at DOCUMENT level, CAPTURE phase,
   PASSIVE. Nothing here calls preventDefault or stopPropagation, ever; nothing here
   reads back into any render path. Capture phase so a record exists even for an
   event some handler downstream consumes, passive so the browser never has to wait
   on this code before scrolling or synthesizing, document level because the panel's
   own gesture layer is already there and a second surface would be a second thing
   that can disagree about what happened.
   OFF REMOVES THE LISTENERS — it does not mute them. A muted listener is still a
   listener the compositor has to consider, and "the diagnostics were off" would

   of clear column left of `clockHm`.
   The content is sized to the tightest of those: the word and the count are STACKED
   the way the moon chip stacks its mode and its remaining time, so the budget is a
   4-character mono string rather than a sentence — 35.2 px at 2560x720 against
