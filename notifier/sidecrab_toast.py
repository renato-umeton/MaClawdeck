"""SideCrab notifier — a native desktop alert when a Claude session has been waiting too long.

Standalone read-only consumer of the crabd feed (``/v1/state``, see docs/STATE-CONTRACT.md).
It polls, decides, and fires at most ONE toast per waiting spell. It never writes config,
never talks to crabd's POST endpoints, and never raises out of the poll loop.

Layering: everything above ``PowerShellToastAdapter`` is pure and headless-testable
(``ToastDecider`` does the deciding, the adapters do the only platform I/O there is).

TOAST MECHANISM — two routes ship, and pick_adapter() chooses one from sys.platform.

Windows route — measured on Windows 11, 2026-08-26:

  Route A (chosen): subprocess to Windows PowerShell 5.1, WinRT projection.
      `[Windows.UI.Notifications.ToastNotificationManager, ..., ContentType=WindowsRuntime]`
      loads, CreateToastNotifier() returns a live ToastNotifier, Show() returns clean.
      Zero pip dependencies — matters because this runs from a Scheduled Task at logon,
      where a missing/older interpreter's site-packages would silently break notifications.

  Route B (rejected): the `winrt-Windows.UI.Notifications` pip package. It downloads fine
      (3.2.1 cp313 wheel), but it is NOT installed here and would pull three packages
      (winrt-runtime + Windows.UI.Notifications + Windows.Data.Xml.Dom) into whichever
      interpreter the task happens to run. Bought us nothing Route A lacks.

  TRAP: pwsh 7 CANNOT do this — `Unable to find type [...ToastNotificationManager]`. The
  WinRT type projection only exists in Windows PowerShell 5.1. Measured, not assumed. So
  POWERSHELL_EXE below is pinned to System32 powershell.exe; do not "modernize" it to pwsh.

  TRAP: under 5.1 the *static* projections `ToastNotifier.Setting` and
  `ToastNotificationManager::History` come back null rather than throwing. They are not
  usable as a "did it show?" check — do not add a delivery assertion built on them.

  A toast needs a registered AppUserModelID. Two are in play, chosen at toast time:

    PREFERRED: "SideCrab.Notifier", registered by setup\\Register-SideCrabAumid.ps1 under
      HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\AppUserModelId. Toasts then group in Action Center as
      "SideCrab" with the SideCrab icon, and Windows' per-app notification switch is ours.

    FALLBACK: Windows PowerShell's own AUMID, which Get-StartApps confirms is registered
      here. Used whenever that registry key is absent — an unregistered box still gets its
      toasts, attributed to "Windows PowerShell". Registering is an upgrade, unregistering
      a downgrade; neither can break notification delivery.

  The toast also carries an "Acknowledge" button (v0.7.0). It activates the `sidecrab-ack:`
  URL protocol rather than this process, because a toast in Action Center outlives the
  notifier — see ACK_SCHEME below and notifier\\sidecrab_ack_handler.pyw.

  This module still WRITES no registry — it only reads, and only to choose between the two.
  A POSITIVE answer is cached for the process lifetime; a negative one is re-probed on a
  cooldown, so a notifier that was running when the installer registered the key picks it up
  on its own (see AUMID_REPROBE_SEC).

macOS route — /usr/bin/osascript, measured on macOS 26.6, 2026-09-04:

  A `display notification` posted by a THREE-CONSTANT AppleScript, with the text riding in
  argv. The measurement that licenses building it that way — argv arrives verbatim, so nothing
  is interpolated and nothing needs escaping — is written once, at MAC_SCRIPT_DISPLAY_LINE.

  Nothing here reads a registry, an AUMID or an icon: there is no identity to register.

  THE SOUND NAME IS NOT A FILE. `sound name "default"` names nothing under
  /System/Library/Sounds, whose 14 entries are Basso…Tink (measured). AppleScript accepts any
  name — an invented `"no-such-sound"` compiles too — and macOS falls back to the user's alert
  sound rather than erroring, which is why the clause survives here: it asks for the default
  and cannot fail. What was NOT verified from this session: that a sound was audible.

  THREE THINGS THIS ROUTE CANNOT DO, all permanent properties of it rather than things to fix:

    NO BUTTONS: `display notification` has no action affordance at all. The Acknowledge and
      Snooze buttons, ACK_SCHEME/SNOOZE_SCHEME and both .pyw handlers are the Windows route's,
      and stay Windows-only — the operator acknowledges on the panel.

    NO REPLACEMENT: it cannot set a replacement identifier, so a second outage notice STACKS
      beneath the first instead of replacing it. STALE_ID's fixed tag and the digest/budget id
      prefixes still keep the deciders' ledgers honest; what they no longer buy on this
      platform is the Action Center slot behaviour they were named for.

    NO IDENTITY: notifications posted through osascript appear under Script Editor's, so the
      macOS per-app notification switch is Script Editor's and MAC_SUBTITLE ("SideCrab") is the
      only thing on screen naming the product.

DIGEST (v0.8.0): a second, unrelated toast — one "yesterday" summary per calendar day at a
  configured local time, off the same 10 s poll loop (no extra thread). Its per-day ledger is
  the ONLY thing this process writes, and it writes it to its own file (STATE_PATH), never to
  config.json — crabd owns that. See DigestDecider.

BUDGET (v0.10.0): a third toast, on the same 10 s loop — ONE per calendar day the first time
  the feed's ``burn.budget.todayPct`` reaches 1.0. It has no config block of its own: crabd
  emits ``burn.budget`` only when a budget is configured, so no budget in the feed = silence.
  Its per-day mark shares STATE_PATH with the digest's under its own key. See BudgetDecider.

APPROVALS (v0.15.0): a fourth toast — a session carrying a live ``pendingPermission`` that
  nobody has decided within ``toast.approvalThresholdSec`` (default 20 s). Informational only:
  it carries NO Approve/Deny buttons, on purpose. See ApprovalDecider.

STALE FEED (v0.15.0): a fifth toast, and the only one about SideCrab itself — ONE per outage
  when crabd stops answering or its ``generatedAt`` stops moving while the operator was
  recently working. Everything else in this file goes silent when crabd is unreachable, which
  is right for questions and wrong for the panel itself: a dead panel looks identical to a
  quiet one. See StaleFeedDecider.

LONG RUN (v0.16.0): a sixth toast — ONE when a session finishes a turn that ran longer than
  ``toast.longRunSec`` (default 900). A 25-minute build/test run is exactly the turn the
  operator walked away from. The duration is DERIVED, not measured here: crabd clears
  ``turnStartedAt`` on Stop (contract), so the only place a finished turn's start still exists
  is the poll BEFORE the ``done`` — hence the one-poll memory in LongRunDecider.

SNOOZE (v0.16.0): the waiting toast gains a second button next to Acknowledge. It activates
  ``sidecrab-snooze:<sessionId>`` (same protocol mechanism, same strict validation) and the
  handler writes a 30-minute mark into STATE_PATH, which this process READS each poll. Snooze
  DEFERS where every other suppression here MARKS — that asymmetry is the feature: the
  operator asked to be told again later, and the session is still, truthfully, waiting.

VERSION (v0.16.0): ``__version__``, a startup log line, ``--version``, and a ``notifier``
  section in STATE_PATH carrying the running version and module path. The notifier could not
  previously tell anyone it was running stale code — a Scheduled Task that has not been
  restarted since the file changed looks identical to a current one, and that class of bug
  cost two separate investigations on 2026-08-26.

VERSION (v0.20.0): doc-only correction (audit NL-a) — MUTED_SWITCH_LINE no longer claims the
  long-run toast re-surfaces on unmute. It does not: LongRunDecider's observation swap is
  unconditional (ahead of the enabled gate), so a working->done that COMPLETES while muted
  consumes the edge. Behaviour unchanged; the line now matches it, and test_mute.py pins it.

# -- macOS: the same seam, a different interpreter ---------------------------------------

#: Absolute path by design, the same way POWERSHELL_EXE is pinned: osascript ships with macOS,
#: and when this runs from a LaunchAgent its PATH is not the operator's login-shell PATH. A bare
#: "osascript" would be resolved against a PATH this process does not control.
MAC_OSASCRIPT = "/usr/bin/osascript"

#: The AppleScript, as three CONSTANT strings handed to osascript with -e. The notification
#: text NEVER appears here: it rides in argv, past the separator, and the script reads it back
#: with `item N of argv`.
#:
#: THE MEASUREMENT THE WHOLE ROUTE RESTS ON, macOS 26.6, 2026-09-04: `osascript -e 'on run
#: argv' ... -- <arg>` passes every argument through byte for byte — a probe carrying a double
#: quote, a backslash, a newline, `$(touch ...)`, backticks, `&` and `; rm -rf /` came back
#: identical, exit 0, with nothing substituted or executed. That is the same property
#: PowerShell's base64 payload buys on the Windows side, obtained by not building a script out
#: of user text at all. The line itself compiles (osacompile, exit 0, pinned by
#: test_mac_adapter.AppleScriptGrammarTests) and has posted live (--test-toast, exit 0).
#:
#: TRAP: interpolating the title or the body into this line is a one-character-looking change
#: that reintroduces AppleScript injection — a `"` in a question would close the string
#: literal. notifier/tests/test_mac_adapter.py asserts these three strings are byte-identical

#: only thing on screen that says which product raised it.
