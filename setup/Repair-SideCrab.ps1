.SYNOPSIS
    The SideCrab doctor: diagnoses the failure modes this install has actually hit, in plain
    English, and optionally applies the safe subset of the fixes. REPORT-ONLY by default.

.DESCRIPTION
    Test-SideCrab.ps1 answers "is it working?" with PASS/FAIL rows. This answers the next
    question - "then what is wrong, and what do I type?" - for the specific ways SideCrab has
    broken before. Every check prints what it saw, why that matters, and the exact command.

    THE CHECKS, and the real incident behind each
      crabd health        crabd not answering on 9999 at all. Probed TWICE, a few seconds apart,
                          before it is called a failure: a single GET reads a healthy crabd as
                          dead right after a task restart, and on this host whenever a loopback
                          SYN-ACK is dropped (docs/BACKLOG.md). A reading that only the retry
                          answered is reported as such - recovered, not hidden.
      crabd owns its port an answer on 9999 with SideCrab-crabd NOT Running. Health-by-HTTP
                          cannot tell WHO replied: a stray non-task process held the port and
                          answered convincingly while the task was dead in Ready with
                          LastTaskResult=1. FAIL, with the holding PID named - and while it
                          holds the port the real task cannot bind at all.
      is running          a registered, ENABLED helper task (glow, toast) that is not Running.
                          Every SideCrab task is a logon daemon, so Ready means the process is
                          gone - and nothing used to ask: crabd had the health probe and the
                          other two had only the freshness row, which reported "nothing is
                          executing" as an OK. crabd is deliberately absent here; the two rows
                          above are its liveness.
      stale code          a task saying Running while the process is older than the code it
                          runs. This is the class nothing else catches: the task is Running,
                          /v1/health answers ok, and the fix you just shipped is not in the
                          process. Caught by comparing the NEWEST mtime across the component's
                          watched files (glow's entry point is a launcher that never changes -
                          watching it alone hid every edit to the glow itself) against the
                          task's LastRunTime, and - decisively - crabd's served version against
                          the VERSION in companion\crabd.py.
      wiring paths        hooks, status line, task actions or a toast handler naming a SideCrab
                          path OUTSIDE this checkout. They still run; they run the other copy.
      statusline invoked  our command installed in settings.json but never actually invoked -
                          /v1/health's lastStatuslineAgeSec is null. "Installed" and "arriving"
                          are different questions and only the first one was askable before.
      consumer schemas    the notifier and the glow pin the schemas they accept. crabd moved to
                          4, then 5; each time a consumer stayed behind it kept running, kept
                          polling and never toasted (or lit) again.
      toast identity      the AUMID missing, so toasts group under "Windows PowerShell".
      toast action        a toast scheme missing or stale, so its button does nothing or raises
                          a shell error. One row per scheme: sidecrab-ack: (Acknowledge) and
                          sidecrab-snooze: (Snooze 30m).
      hook allow-list     allowedHttpHookUrls set without our URL - the CLI then never calls the
                          http hooks at all, and panel approvals silently never arm.
      config parse        ~/.sidecrab/config.json unparseable; every consumer falls back to
                          defaults without saying so.

    -Fix APPLIES ONLY THE SAFE SUBSET, each one ShouldProcess-gated:
      * start a registered, ENABLED, not-running task
      * restart a task that is Running on stale code
      * (re-)register the toast AUMID and the toast schemes (sidecrab-ack:, sidecrab-snooze:) -
        HKCU, idempotent, exactly what the installer writes

    EVERY START GOES THROUGH Restart-SideCrabTask, never a bare Start-ScheduledTask: it waits
    for the port to be released and refuses to start rather than losing the bind race. And
    while a foreign process holds 9999 the start fix is not offered at ALL - the port-owner row
    carries that story, and starting into a held port is the 2026-08-27 incident itself.

    A FIX COUNTS ONLY WHEN IT IS VERIFIED. Each fixable row states what "worked" means and that
    is re-measured after the action runs; not throwing is not fixed. Start-ScheduledTask returns
    the moment the scheduler accepts the request, so a process that started and immediately died
    used to be marked fixed, leave the standing count, and exit 0 under a printed
    "still not answering".

    -Fix NEVER:
      * writes settings.json - hooks, statusLine and allowedHttpHookUrls are the operator's
        file; the report prints the command that changes them and stops there
      * writes config.json, and never enables panel approvals - arming approvals is a security
        posture, taken deliberately by Install-SideCrab.ps1 -WithApprovals
      * enables a DISABLED task - a disabled task is a decision (the glow is parked on the
        headless SDK crash, docs/BACKLOG.md), and re-enabling it here would start it into that
        crash. Enable-ScheduledTask is the deliberate override.

    Exit code is 0 when no FAIL row stands (a row fixed in this run counts as handled), 1
    otherwise - so this is CI-safe.
