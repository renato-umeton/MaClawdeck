.SYNOPSIS
    Shared helpers for the SideCrab setup scripts (Install / Uninstall / Update).

.DESCRIPTION
    Dot-sourced by the three setup scripts. Nothing here runs at load time: the file
    defines functions only, so dot-sourcing it can never change machine state.

    The pure decision helpers - Get-SideCrabComponentSpec, Select-SideCrabComponent,
    Get-SideCrabTaskName, Get-SideCrabHookEvent - take every input as a parameter and
    touch neither the filesystem, the task scheduler nor the network. setup/tests lifts
    them out of this file by AST and exercises them without running an install.

    <# The toast app identity, as one object every caller reads instead of re-deriving.
       Pure: Join-Path does no I/O and the registry is not touched here.

       WHY THIS EXISTS: without a registered AppUserModelID the notifier has to borrow
       Windows PowerShell's, so Action Center groups SideCrab's toasts under "Windows
       PowerShell" and Windows' per-app notification switch for SideCrab is really
       PowerShell's. Registering our own is a HKCU write - no elevation, no COM server,
       no Start-menu shortcut - and the notifier picks it up by probing for this key.

       ComponentKey ties the registration to the toast component: an install without
       toast must not leave an app identity behind for a notifier that is not there. #>

function Get-SideCrabAumidIconDecision {
    <# What the AUMID key's IconUri value SHOULD be, given whether the icon file is actually
       on disk, and what to do about the value that is there now. Pure.

       THE TRAP THIS CLOSES: the icon file can go (a repo move, a checkout without it) while
       the registry keeps pointing at where it used to be. Both halves failed independently -
       the state read compared IconUri against the spec path and called that "current" without
       ever asking whether the file existed, and the re-registration wrote DisplayName only
       and left the dead IconUri in place, because New-ItemProperty -Force does not clear a
       value it is not given a value for. The result was a key that reads healthy, renders no
       icon, and cannot be repaired by re-running the installer.

       Expected is $null when the icon is missing: an IconUri pointing at nothing renders as no
       icon with NO error, which is strictly worse than an absent value that reads as "not set"
       on inspection. Remove is $true only when a value is registered that Expected says should
       not be - so the caller deletes rather than leaving a dead pointer behind. #>

    <# The toast's buttons, ONE ROW PER URL SCHEME - the table every caller loops over
       instead of re-deriving. Pure: Join-Path does no I/O and the registry is not touched.

       WHY A PROTOCOL: a toast sits in Action Center until it is dismissed, long after the
       notifier process that raised it may have gone. An activation that called back into
       that process would be dead on arrival; a registered URL scheme is routed by the
       shell, which is still there. Each handler validates the URI it receives - see
       notifier\sidecrab_ack_handler.pyw and notifier\sidecrab_snooze_handler.pyw.

       TWO SCHEMES, NOT ONE (v0.16.0): Acknowledge answers the question, Snooze defers the
       toast for 30 minutes and deliberately never touches crabd (notifier\README.md,
       "Snooze 30m"). They are separate schemes because they are separate handlers: an
       unregistered scheme is a button the shell silently no-ops, which is how Snooze
       shipped inert. Adding a row here is all Install/Uninstall/-Status need.

       ComponentKey ties every registration to the toast component, exactly as the AUMID
       does: an install without toast must not leave a scheme pointing at a handler for a
       notifier that is not there. #>

       between the truncate and the last byte lost the operator's config outright. A temp+rename
       makes the live file either the old bytes or the new bytes, never a half-written mix.

       The temp sits BESIDE the target, not in %TEMP%, so the rename is a same-volume move
       (atomic); a cross-volume move would silently fall back to copy+delete and lose the
       guarantee. [System.IO.File]::Move(overwrite) is used rather than Move-Item -Force because
       the .NET call documents the atomic replace; Move-Item's atomicity is not contractual. The

    <# Stop a SideCrab task, wait for it to actually be GONE, then start it again. The ONE
       restart path: Update-SideCrab.ps1 and Repair-SideCrab.ps1 both call this rather than
       carrying a copy each, which is how one of them kept the race after the other was fixed.

       Two waits, and the second is the one the incident was about:
         1. the task leaving Running - starting a task that is still stopping is silently
            ignored by the scheduler;
         2. the PORT being released, for a component that owns one. A task leaves Running while
            the process's listening socket is still open, and the new instance then cannot bind
            (see Wait-SideCrabPortRelease).

       ON TIMEOUT IT DOES NOT START. Starting blind is what produced the dark panel: the restart
       "succeeded", the new process exited 1, and the only trace was LastTaskResult=1 on a task
       reading Ready. This throws instead, naming the PID that still holds the port - a foreign
       process there is a different problem from a slow shutdown, and the PID is the only thing
       that tells them apart.

       Every -*Task / -*Probe / -Wait scriptblock is injected by the suite, so the whole restart
       runs with no scheduler and no socket. #>

       WHY BOTH (measured 2026-08-27): health-by-HTTP cannot tell WHO is answering. After a
       failed restart a stray non-task process held 9999 and answered /v1/health convincingly
       while SideCrab-crabd sat in Ready with LastTaskResult=1 - so the single check the updater
       made reported success over a task that was not running, and the panel stayed dark. An
       answer with no Running task is not "fine": it is the loudest row on the list, because it
       is also the thing that stops the real instance from ever binding.

       The four cases, and why each is different:
         ok                answering, and the task owns it.
         not-answering     task Running, nothing answered - starting up, or up and unbound.

       THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES: -TaskName narrowed the TASK deletion and nothing else, so

       restore the status line and clear panelApprovals - tearing down a crabd install the
       operator had not asked about. (The two HKCU registrations were already narrowed; every
       other surface was not.)

       THE RULE: a narrowed uninstall removes only the named component's OWN surface. A full
       sweep removes everything. Ownership, once, here:
         crabd -> the settings.json hooks (they POST to crabd), the status line (it feeds
                  crabd) and the panelApprovals key (crabd's gate)
         toast -> the AUMID and the button schemes
         glow  -> its task, and nothing else
       A -TaskName that matches no component in the catalogue owns nothing beyond that task:

       THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES: the restore read the chain file and wrote the saved prior over

       ours. Install SideCrab, then install a different status line B, then uninstall SideCrab,
       and B was silently replaced by the status line SideCrab had displaced months earlier.
       The null-prior branch was worse: with no prior saved it called Remove('statusLine') and
       B was deleted outright.

       THE RULE - the same one the hook removal already follows: never write over a value that
       is not ours. Ownership is the marker match (Test-SideCrabStatusLineIsOurs), which is why
       CurrentIsOurs is a parameter here rather than re-derived. An ABSENT status line is not a
       foreign one: there is nothing to preserve, so a saved prior goes back into an empty slot.

       touch. So the promised stop never came, the tasks restarted, and the operator's
       uncommitted work stayed live under a repo that had moved. Measured on this very tree
       2026-08-27: ` M README.md` standing, and no incoming commit touching README.md would
       have been stopped by anything.

       Tracked changes BLOCK. Untracked files only WARN: they are not overwritten unless an
