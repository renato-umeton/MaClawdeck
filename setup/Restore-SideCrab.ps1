.SYNOPSIS
    Lists, restores and prunes the timestamped backups SideCrab writes before it rewrites
    settings.json (default) or, with -Config, ~/.sidecrab/config.json - the supported way
    back from an install, update, uninstall or a panelApprovals toggle.

.DESCRIPTION
    Install-SideCrab.ps1 and Uninstall-SideCrab.ps1 copy ~/.claude/settings.json to
    "<path>.sidecrab-bak-yyyyMMdd-HHmmss" before every write, and Set/Clear-SideCrabPanelApprovals
    now do the same for ~/.sidecrab/config.json before every rewrite (SET-a2). This script is the
    other half of that: it reads the pile, explains what each backup would change, and puts one
    back. -Config points it at config.json's backups instead of settings.json's; the naming
    convention is identical, so the listing, restore and prune all work the same way.

    Config restores skip the SideCrab-vs-foreign split below: config.json is entirely SideCrab's
    own data file (quiet hours, recap repos, toast threshold, the panelApprovals key), so there is
    no third party's keys to protect - a restore simply replaces the whole file, backing up the
    current one first.

    THE ONE HAZARD, AND THE GUARD

    A restore replaces the WHOLE file, so it also reverts every key SideCrab does not own -
    permissions, theme, plugins, another tool's hooks - that the operator changed since the
    backup was taken. Those edits are invisible in a diff of SideCrab's own keys, which is
    exactly why they get lost.

    So every restore is compared first, split into the part SideCrab owns (its hook entries
    and its statusLine) and everything else. SideCrab-key differences are the POINT of a
    restore and never block. A FOREIGN key that differs does block: the script prints the
    keys, refuses, and prints the -Force command that overrides it. -Force is a statement
    that those edits are meant to go.

    A restore is itself reversible: the CURRENT settings.json is backed up - with the same
    naming convention, so it shows up in the next -List - before the restore is written.

    PRUNING
    -PruneOlderThan <days> deletes backups older than N days, except the newest one, which is
    never pruned at any age. A pile that is entirely older than the cutoff is what a stable
    install looks like, and pruning it to zero removes the only way back from the install
    that is running right now.

    Timestamps come from the backup's NAME, never its mtime: Copy-Item preserves the source's
    timestamp, so a backup taken today of a settings.json last edited in June has a June mtime.
