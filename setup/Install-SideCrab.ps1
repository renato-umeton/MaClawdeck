.SYNOPSIS
    Installs the SideCrab companion: logon Scheduled Tasks for crabd (and, when
    present, glow and toast), plus the Claude Code hook entries that feed them.

.DESCRIPTION
    Idempotent parts, any of which can be run alone:
      1. Scheduled Tasks - one per selected component, started at logon, hidden,
         restarting on failure. crabd is always installed; glow and toast are
         optional (see COMPONENTS). Installing toast also makes two HKCU registrations:
         SideCrab's own toast identity (setup\Register-SideCrabAumid.ps1) so notifications
         are attributed to SideCrab rather than to Windows PowerShell, and the toast's
         button protocols (setup\Register-SideCrabProtocol.ps1) - 'sidecrab-ack:' for
         Acknowledge and 'sidecrab-snooze:' for Snooze 30m.
      2. Merges hooks/settings-hooks-fragment.json into ~/.claude/settings.json (the five
         curl ingest hooks plus the two type-http control hooks, Stop and PermissionRequest).
      3. Installs the status-line command (hooks\sidecrab_statusline.py) into
         ~/.claude/settings.json, SAVING any pre-existing statusLine to
         ~/.sidecrab/statusline-chain.json first so the chain script can call it and Uninstall
         can restore it. Skip with -SkipStatusLine.
      4. Sets ~/.sidecrab/config.json panelApprovals.enabled. DEFAULT is FALSE (panel approval
         off); -WithApprovals turns it on and prints a one-line security notice.

    Re-running is safe: tasks are re-registered from scratch and the hook merge is
    matched on the crabd URL, so entries are never duplicated and other hooks are
    left untouched. A task the operator DISABLED stays disabled across a re-run - it is
    re-registered (paths stay current) and put straight back into Disabled, and it is not
    started; -ForceEnable is the deliberate override. The prior status line is saved only when it is not already ours, so a
    re-run never captures our own command. settings.json is backed up (timestamped) before
    any write.

    COMPONENTS
      crabd  always installed          companion\crabd.py
      glow   -WithGlow, or auto        lighting\glow_launcher.pyw
      toast  -WithToast, or auto       notifier\sidecrab_toast.py

    With no switches, an optional component is installed when its script file
    exists and skipped when it does not. Passing -WithGlow / -WithToast for a
    script that is missing is an error, not a silent skip.

    GLOW ALSO HAS TO IMPORT. Its script file existing is what auto-selects it, and that says
    nothing about whether cuesdk is installed - without it the launcher starts, raises
    ImportError and exits, leaving a Registered task that has never controlled a light. So
    `import cuesdk` is run under the interpreter the task will use, before the task is
    registered. Auto-detected + not importable = SKIPPED with the pip line, because
    auto-detection is an inference and the failed import refutes it. -WithGlow + not importable
    = registered anyway, loudly: an explicit switch is an instruction, and failing the whole
    install (crabd included) over a lighting dependency would be the worse outcome.
