.SYNOPSIS
    Updates the SideCrab companion in place: fast-forward the repo, restart the
    registered SideCrab-* tasks, then wait for /v1/health to come back ok.

.DESCRIPTION
    Three steps, each of them reversible or read-only:
      1. git -C <repo> pull --ff-only   - a fast-forward or nothing, and only into a tree with
         no tracked modifications. The clean check is our own (git status --porcelain, read
         BEFORE the pull): --ff-only refuses a merge and refuses to clobber a file the incoming
         commits touch, but fast-forwards straight over local edits to any file they do not -
         so "dirty tree, no pull" was a promise nothing kept. A diverged tree still fails the
         pull itself. Untracked files warn and do not block.
      2. Restart ONLY the SideCrab-* tasks that are actually registered, through the
         shared Restart-SideCrabTask - which waits for the OLD process to release the
         port before starting the new one, and refuses to start at all if it does not
         come free. A component that was never installed is not started here.
      3. Verify BOTH that /v1/health answers ok (default timeout 30 s) AND that
         SideCrab-crabd is actually Running. An answer with the task not Running is a
         FAIL naming the PID that holds the port, not a pass: health-by-HTTP cannot
         tell who answered. Exits non-zero when that check does not stand.

    THE WIDGET IS NOT UPDATED BY THIS SCRIPT. The Xeneon Edge widget is installed
    into iCUE by importing the .icuewidget package; pulling the repo changes the
    source in widget\, never what iCUE is running.
