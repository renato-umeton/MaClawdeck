"""SideCrab setup for macOS: settings.json, config.json and the LaunchAgents.

One module, stdlib only, importable. Structured the way ``SideCrab.Common.ps1`` is:
pure decision helpers first, then the thin impure wrappers that carry them out, then
the commands. Every impure dependency - launchctl, security, lsof, HTTP, the clock,
the interpreter probe - reaches this module through :class:`Environment`, so the whole
suite runs headless against a temporary HOME with nothing installed.

PORT = 9999
BASE_URL = f"http://127.0.0.1:{PORT}"

#: The ONE substring that says "SideCrab wrote this settings.json entry". A command hook
#: carries it in `command`, an http hook in `url`, so the concatenation of the two finds
#: both kinds. Install, status, doctor and uninstall all match on this and nothing else -
#: a second copy is how a stale entry from an older port survives an upgrade.
HOOK_MARKER = f"127.0.0.1:{PORT}/v1/hook"

#: What allowedHttpHookUrls must admit for the two http hooks (Stop, PermissionRequest)
#: to be called at all. Both spellings: the allow-list matches the URL as written, and a
#: settings.json that reaches crabd through localhost is as legitimate as one that does
#: not. Arrays merge across settings files, so a project-level list matters too.
ALLOWED_HOOK_PATTERNS = (f"http://127.0.0.1:{PORT}/*", f"http://localhost:{PORT}/*")
