.SYNOPSIS
    Preflight checker + written procedure for verifying SideCrab panel approval on a live
    Claude Code permission prompt. It NEVER enables approvals and never approves anything.

.DESCRIPTION
    Panel approval (contract v0.12.0 §4) is settled on paper - the PermissionRequest response
    shape was read out of the shipped v2.1.246 zod schema - but it has never been exercised
    against a real CLI prompt. This script is the on-machine procedure that closes that gap:

      1. It runs a READ-ONLY preflight over the things that must already be true (crabd up and
         new enough to serve /v1/hook/permission, the PermissionRequest hook wired into
         settings.json and not blocked by allowedHttpHookUrls, the current approvals posture).
      2. It prints the EXACT steps and commands for the live run: enable, trigger a real prompt
         in a DISPOSABLE session, approve it, confirm the CLI honoured it, then deny one.

    What it deliberately does NOT do, and must never be changed to do:
      - it does not write config.json, settings.json or the registry, and never enables
        approvals (that is `Install-SideCrab.ps1 -WithApprovals`, an operator decision);
      - it does not POST a `decide` - an automated approver is the exact thing panel approval
        exists to prevent. The taps in step 3 are the operator's.

    Exit code: 0 when the preflight is green (ready to run the live verification), 1 when a
    blocker stands. -DryRun always exits 0.

.PARAMETER DryRun
    Explain only. No HTTP call is made and no file is read for state - the script prints what
    it WOULD check and the full procedure. Use this to read the procedure without touching
    a running crabd.
