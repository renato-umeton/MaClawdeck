# Security

## Threat model, in one paragraph

Everything runs on one machine. The companion (`crabd`) listens on `127.0.0.1:9999` only, never
on a LAN interface, and as of crabd 0.31.0 it also SERVES THE PANEL itself on that port, so the
panel is an ordinary page in a browser rather than only a widget inside iCUE. It reads
`~/.claude` (session transcripts, hook payloads, the usage endpoint's OAuth token) strictly
read-only, never writes there, and never logs or transmits the token. The panel, the notifier
and the glow are read-only consumers of the same localhost feed. Nothing in this repo makes a
network request to anywhere but `127.0.0.1` and, for usage limits, Anthropic's own API with the
user's own token. There is no telemetry, no crash reporting, no update check.

The two things an attacker on this machine, or a web page you visit, could want are:

1. **read** what your sessions are doing (`/v1/state`), and
2. **write** to a session - queue a canned "continue" prompt, or approve a pending permission.

## What is enforced

- **`Host` allowlist, ahead of every other gate (crabd 0.31.0).** A present `Host` whose host
  part is not `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]`, or whose port part is present and is not the
  bound port, is refused `403 {"error":"host not allowed"}` with no CORS header, on `GET`, `POST`
  and `OPTIONS` alike; an absent `Host` (HTTP/1.0, a hand-rolled probe) is allowed. This is the
  DNS-rebinding gate, and it is the only one that can be: a page at `http://evil.example:9999`
  whose name re-resolves to `127.0.0.1` is SAME-ORIGIN with crabd as far as the browser is
  concerned, so its `GET` carries no `Origin` at all and the origin allowlist has nothing to
  refuse it with. `docs/STATE-CONTRACT.md` v0.31.0 §2.
- **Origin allowlist on every route, reads and writes.** The only `http(s)` origins accepted are
  the three spellings of this crabd's own bound port (`http://localhost:<port>`,
  `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`, `http://[::1]:<port>`), matched exactly and case-insensitively.
  Every other web origin - including the same host on a different port, and the same authority
  over `https` - is refused `403` with no CORS header, so a visited web page cannot read the
  state or post an action through a cross-origin fetch. `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` is
  illegal on every route, method and status. `docs/STATE-CONTRACT.md` v0.31.0 §3.
- **Every POST carries `X-SideCrab-Panel` (crabd 0.31.0).** Any non-empty value; a POST without
  it is refused `403 {"error":"panel header required"}`, on every path including the unknown
  ones. It is not a secret and the value is never read. What it does is make the request
  NON-SIMPLE, so a browser must preflight it - and the preflight only lists the header for an
  origin the allowlist already trusts or a non-web scheme, never for `null`.
  `docs/STATE-CONTRACT.md` v0.31.0 §4.
- **The panel crabd serves is confined to its own directory.** `GET /` serves `index.html`, and
  only a path whose first segment is `styles`, `scripts`, `resources` or `mock` serves a file;
  everything else under the panel root is `404`. One percent-decode, then a refusal of `..`
  segments, backslashes, NULs, empty segments, dot-segments and surviving `%`; the resolved
  candidate must sit under the resolved panel directory, which also refuses a symlink pointing
  out of the tree. Static replies carry `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and
  `Cache-Control: no-store`, and the same origin gate as the API.
- **Fixed vocabulary, never free text.** `POST /v1/action` accepts acknowledge, dismiss, pin,
  one of the configured continue prompts, and approve/deny. `reply` with arbitrary text answers
  `501` and will keep doing so until a supported injection mechanism exists.
- **Panel approvals ship OFF.** The installer asks. Every failure mode of the approval path
  (timeout, no tap, disabled, malformed, companion down) is a pass-through to the normal terminal
  dialog. The terminal dialog is raced, not suppressed.
- **Never auto-allow.** crabd has no code path that answers "allow" without a `decide` request
  arriving first.
- **A `decide` needs the pairing code and the request id (crabd 0.29.0).** crabd mints a
  ten-symbol code into `~/.sidecrab/panel-token` (2^50 space, constant-time compare, ten
  rejects a minute lock the gate for a minute; the code is never served, `/v1/health` reports
  presence and lockout only). The widget holds it as an iCUE property, which no web page can
  read. Each pending request carries a `requestId` the tap must echo, checked under the same
  lock that applies the decision. A companion with no gate object answers `503`, never `204`.
  *(The iCUE-property sentence is the iCUE build's answer and only that. A panel served by
  crabd in a browser has no iCUE properties; where it keeps the code, and why that guarantee
  is weaker, is the next bullet. Everything else about the gate - the space, the compare, the
  lockout, the `requestId`, the `503` - is the same on both.)*
- **Where the browser panel keeps the pairing code (widget 0.30.0), and how that guarantee is
  weaker.** The panel crabd serves stores the code in `localStorage` on the origin
  `http://localhost:9999`, inside the one namespaced object it keeps its settings and display
  state in. What that buys: only a page on the panel's own origin can read it, so no other page
  the operator visits can - the same-origin policy is the mechanism, and it is the browser's,
  not ours. A same-user local process can read it, but that was always true: the code is a file
  at `~/.sidecrab/panel-token` that any such process can open, which is why it is a disclosed
  residual below rather than a new one.

  **This is weaker than the iCUE-property claim it replaces, and deliberately so.** An iCUE
  property lives in a host process no web content can reach at all; `localStorage` is reachable
  by any script that runs on that origin. So an XSS in the panel itself, or a browser extension
  with storage access, could read the code - neither of which could touch the property form.
  There is no version in which **the page itself holds the secret** that avoids this: a value
  the page can send is a value the page can read.

  **There is a version in which the page does not hold it, and it was not taken.** crabd could
  mint an `HttpOnly` session cookie on the panel's own origin; the browser would attach it to
  every `decide` and no script on the page - ours, an injected one, or an extension's - could
  read it back. That is strictly stronger and it is the obvious next move. It is not this
  change because it is a different feature: it needs a cookie the daemon issues and rotates, a
  pairing flow that is a request rather than a value the operator types, and a `decide` wire
  shape without a `token` member - and this port deliberately changed neither the pairing flow
  nor the wire. Recorded as a residual below rather than done badly here.

  What is unchanged is everything the code is one factor of. A `decide` still needs the code AND
  a `requestId` that matches the request the panel is showing, checked under the lock that
  applies the decision; ten rejects a minute lock the gate for a minute; the daemon is bound to
  loopback and refuses every web origin but its own. Reading the code is not by itself a
  decision, and the vectors that could read it are vectors that could already drive the panel.
- **The optional long-lived limits token is protected by the platform's own store.** On
  **Windows**, `Install-SideCrab.ps1 -LimitsToken` stores a `claude setup-token` value in
  `~/.sidecrab/limits-token.dpapi`, encrypted for the current Windows user (no entropy). On
  **macOS** (crabd 0.34.0), `setup/install.sh --limits-token` stores it as the login-Keychain
  generic-password item `SideCrab limits token`, and the value travels in on `security -i`'s
  **stdin**, hex-encoded - never in an argument list, because `ps` is world-readable there.
  Either way crabd reads it fresh in memory per poll, sends it only to Anthropic's usage
  endpoint over HTTPS, and never logs, serves or copies it. Neither command prints it back, and
  `--status` reports presence only. Revoke it from your Anthropic account settings; delete the
  file, or the Keychain item, to stop using it.
- **Claude Code's own credential is read, never written or copied (crabd 0.34.0).** On macOS it
  lives in the login Keychain as `Claude Code-credentials`, and crabd reads
  `~/.claude/.credentials.json` first and that item second, through `/usr/bin/security`. A
  Keychain that refuses the read is served as *unavailable* with a note naming the prompt to
  approve - never as a guess, and never confused with "there are no credentials", because the
  two have different fixes. `docs/STATE-CONTRACT.md` v0.34.0 §1, §2 and §4.
- **Atomic config writes, bounded caches, never-500.** A failed config write cannot empty
  `config.json`; every ring and LRU is capped so a flood cannot grow memory; malformed input is
  answered with a 4xx and a sanitised body.

## Disclosed residuals (open)

- **A same-user local process can read the pairing code.** It can also read `~/.claude`, drive
  the terminal dialog and inject keystrokes, so it was never inside the threat model of a
  localhost service; the gate exists for the web-page vector, which it closes.
- **The browser panel holds the pairing code where its own page can read it** (widget 0.30.0).
  `localStorage` on `http://localhost:9999`, so an XSS in the panel or an extension with
  storage access could read it, where an iCUE property could not. An `HttpOnly` cookie minted
  by crabd would avoid it and is the intended next move; it is a change to the pairing flow and
  the `decide` wire shape, neither of which this port touched. See "Where the browser panel
  keeps the pairing code" under **What is enforced** for the full argument and for what the
  code is only one factor of.
- **`/v1/state` is readable by a forged `null` Origin.** Still open, and still deliberate: a
  QtWebEngine build that collapses its page to an opaque origin has no other value it could
  send, so refusing `null` risks refusing the product on a build nobody has measured. (The one
  build that HAS been measured reports `file://` - ORIGIN-b.) It discloses what your sessions
  are doing, not a way to act on them.
- ~~**A forged `null` Origin can WRITE - queue-continue, and any other POST.**~~ **CLOSED in
  crabd 0.31.0 (2026-09-04)** by the panel header. A custom request header makes the POST
  non-simple, so the browser must preflight it, and `do_OPTIONS` never lists
  `X-SideCrab-Panel` for `Origin: null` - a forged-null page therefore comes back from its
  preflight without permission to send the header its POST needs, while `null` READS stay
  allowed. The iCUE build itself is unaffected because its origin was measured as `file://`,
  not `null` (ORIGIN-b, `originsSeen` 2026-09-02), and a web page cannot forge that; a build
  that reports `null` instead would keep its reads and lose its taps, which is the accepted
  trade rather than an oversight. Pinned by `companion/tests/test_crabd_panel.py`:
  `PanelPreflightTests.test_null_may_never_unlock_the_header`,
  `PanelHeaderGateTests.test_a_post_without_the_header_is_refused_with_its_own_body` and
  `.test_every_post_path_requires_it_including_the_unknown_ones`.
- **queue-continue is still on and unauthenticated for a LOCAL process.** Bounded by the
  server-side whitelist: the worst case is a canned "Continue" / "Run the tests" / "Commit +
  push" pushed into a live session by something already running as you. Not remote code
  execution; still a nudge you did not send. The browser half of this is now closed by the
  header gate above.
- ~~**A page whose own DNS re-resolves to 127.0.0.1 can read the feed.**~~ **CLOSED in crabd
  0.31.0 (2026-09-04)** by the `Host` allowlist above. Nobody had written this one down, because
  it costs nothing while the panel is a widget loaded from disk - and everything the moment
  crabd serves a page on a real web origin, which is the same release. Pinned by
  `companion/tests/test_crabd_panel.py` `HostAllowlistTests`:
  `test_a_rebound_hostname_is_refused`, `test_a_loopback_name_on_the_wrong_port_is_refused`,
  `test_the_host_gate_answers_before_the_origin_gate`.
- **The panel lives on a real web origin, reachable by any browser on the machine.** That is the
  new exposure and it is stated plainly: `http://localhost:9999` is a page anything can navigate
  to. What that buys an attacker is bounded by the three gates. A page the operator opens cannot
  READ the feed cross-origin (it is not on the origin allowlist), cannot WRITE (its preflight is
  refused, so it never obtains the header), and cannot make itself same-origin by rebinding its
  own name onto 127.0.0.1 (the `Host` gate). A same-user local process still can do all three -
  it can also read `~/.claude`, drive the terminal dialog and inject keystrokes, so it was never
  inside the threat model. Approvals additionally need the pairing code, a matching `requestId`, and
  survive the lockout - unchanged.

## Closed

- **SEC-a - forged `null` Origin could approve a pending permission** (2026-08-28 audit). The
  widget's opaque QtWebEngine origin serialises as `Origin: null`, which a sandboxed iframe can
  forge, so the origin gate alone could not tell them apart. **Closed in crabd 0.29.0 / widget
  0.27.0** by the pairing code above: the forged page has the origin but not the code.
- **WID-a - no per-request id on `decide`.** Closed in the same release: `pendingPermission.requestId`
  is echoed by the tap and a mismatch is `409`, decided under the broker's lock.

The full audit trail, including the findings that are now fixed (SEC-1 to SEC-5), is in
`docs/findings/audit-security.md` and `docs/findings/QA-Audit-2026-08-28.md`.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Open a private report through GitHub's "Report a vulnerability" on
<https://github.com/Dixie-sketch/Clawdeck/security>, or open an issue if the finding is not
exploitable. Say what you observed, how to reproduce it, and which component and version: the
widget's from `widget/manifest.json`, and crabd's from the `version` field of
<http://127.0.0.1:9999/v1/health> or `VERSION` in `companion/crabd.py`. crabd takes no
arguments, so there is no `--version` flag to run. There is no bug bounty; there is a
maintainer who will read it.
