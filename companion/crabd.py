"""crabd - SideCrab companion service.

Serves the /v1/state document defined in docs/STATE-CONTRACT.md (schema 5, the last
breaking shape; the v0.6.x through v0.28.0 fields ride on it additively) on
127.0.0.1:9999 for the SideCrab panel, from eleven sources:

  1. Claude Code hooks POSTed to /v1/hook  -> session state machine, per-session events
  2. ~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl         -> titles, model, token burn, questions,
                                              contextTokens
  3. the Claude OAuth usage endpoint       -> 5-hour / weekly limit gauges (the FALLBACK
                                              source since v0.12.0)
  4. ~/.sidecrab/config.json               -> quiet hours, the quiet OVERRIDE (v0.23.0),
                                              toast, digest, the burn budget, panel
                                              approvals, the reply gate
  5. `git log` in today's session cwds     -> recap.commits, recap.week[].commits
  6. `schtasks /query` on Windows, `launchctl print gui/<uid>/<label>` on macOS
                                           -> fleet (glow / toast)
  7. ~/.sidecrab/history.jsonl             -> replayed at startup so doneToday, the
                                              per-session events ring and recap.week
                                              survive a crabd restart
  8. the status line document on /v1/statusline (v0.12.0) -> limits and per-session
                                              context, officially, with no OAuth token
                                              in the picture; PREFERRED over source 3
  9. OTLP http/json on /v1/metrics + /v1/logs (v0.12.0) -> burn.costUSD in real dollars,
                                              api_error events onto the session rings
 10. GetSystemTimes / GlobalMemoryStatusEx on Windows, mach host_statistics /
     host_statistics64 / sysctlbyname on macOS (v0.22.0, v0.32.0)
                                           -> `host`: this machine's CPU
                                              utilization and memory, for the panel
                                              beside the iCUE temperature sensors
 11. GET /v1/models on the same OAuth token (v0.28.0) -> the context WINDOW size behind
                                              contextWindowTokens, for a model id that
                                              carries no [1m]/[200k] marker (which is
                                              every live one); ranked BELOW the status
                                              line and the marker, both session-specific

and accepts touch actions on /v1/action (ack / ack-all / queue-continue / decide /
quiet; reply is 501, see below), answers the Stop and PermissionRequest hooks on
/v1/hook/stop and /v1/hook/permission, plus quietHours / toast / digest / budget
writes on /v1/config.

/v1/panel-log (v0.24.0) is a SIDE CHANNEL, not a source: the widget POSTs short
diagnostic lines to it and a maintainer GETs them back, because iCUE renders the widget on
a surface no devtools can reach. It is in-memory only, it feeds nothing, and nothing in
here ever reads a stored line back into a decision.

stdlib only, Python 3.13, macOS and Windows hosts. ~/.claude is read strictly read-only.

#    "is it > 1" the way LimitsReader._window has to guess - 0.4 here means 0.4%, and
#    guessing would render a nearly-empty gauge as 40% full.
#  - `resets_at` is EPOCH SECONDS, a number. The CLI's own consumer does
#    `Number.isFinite(x)` then `Math.min(...)*1000`, which is only true of seconds.
#  - `rate_limits` is ABSENT ENTIRELY when neither window exists (API key, Bedrock,

# nowhere, the second only as an Agent SDK spawn option. Both would be silently ignored.
# The schema that ships accepts, verbatim:
#     { continue?: bool, suppressOutput?: bool, stopReason?: str,
#       decision?: "approve" | "block", reason?: str, systemMessage?: str,
#       terminalSequence?: str, hookSpecificOutput?: <union> }
# which leaves TWO shapes that both continue the session, and they differ only in how the
# CLI LABELS the text. v0.15.0 switched to the second. MEASURED in the shipped 2.1.246
# binary (2026-08-26), all four facts read off the same normalizer/turn loop:
#
#  1. WHY THE SWITCH. `decision:"block"` normalizes to `blockingError`, and the turn loop
#     pushes its string into the hook_errors array whose non-emptiness is the ONLY thing
#     that fires `Stop hook error occurred \xB7 ctrl+o to see`. The transcript then renders
#     it as `<hookLabel ?? "Stop"> hook error: <reason>`, and the MODEL is handed
#     `Stop hook blocking error from command: "<url>": <reason>`. Nothing failed; the
#     operator sees red and the model hedges about being nudged by an error. Measured in
#     a live session, docs/spikes/live-verify.md 2.3.
#  2. WHAT REPLACES IT. `hookSpecificOutput: {hookEventName:"Stop", additionalContext}` is
#     a real member of the union (`case "Stop": case "SubagentStop":` in the normalizer
#     lifts `additionalContext` out), described in the binary as "non-error feedback
#     delivered to the model; the conversation continues so the model can act on it" and
#     kept in a SEPARATE `hook_additional_context` field "so the sanctioned feedback
#     channel is not labeled an error". The model receives
#     `Stop hook additional context: <prompt>` instead.
#  3. IT STILL CONTINUES - the load-bearing half. Both branches of the turn loop push
#     their attachment onto the SAME messages array, and the caller's test for "force
#     another turn" is `blockingErrors.length > 0` on that array, not on the error
#     strings. So additionalContext takes the identical continuation path (and the same
#     CLAUDE_CODE_STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP=8 consecutive-block ceiling); only the labelling
#     differs. A prettier shape that let the session stop would have been a regression.
#  4. hookEventName IS CHECKED. The normalizer throws "Hook returned incorrect event
#     name: expected 'Stop' but got '<x>'" - so this constant is not cosmetic, and
#     SubagentStop would need its own value.

#    does not, and a PermissionRequest hookSpecificOutput carrying it fails validation.

# --------------------------------------------------- v0.19.0: clearing a needs_input
# THE GAP THIS CLOSES (operator-reported, 2026-08-27). The Notification hook is what
# sets `needs_input`, and Claude Code fires it for BOTH shapes of waiting: an idle
# prompt AND a permission dialog ("Claude needs your permission to use Bash" is a real
# measured message). Only a later hook could clear it, and the two ways the operator
# most often answers IN THE APP fire no hook at all:
#   - Allow/Deny on the terminal permission dialog. The PermissionRequest hook already
#     returned its pass-through when the dialog appeared; the CLI emits nothing at
#     decision time. The next hook is `Stop`, which can be an hour of tool work away.
#   - Picking an option on an AskUserQuestion sheet. That answer is a tool_result, not
#     a prompt, so `UserPromptSubmit` never fires.
# In both cases the panel kept alerting - and ESCALATING (the widget deepens at 5 min
# and 15 min unacked) - on a question that was answered seconds in.
#
# THE CLEARING SIGNAL IS THE TRANSCRIPT'S OWN TURN CLOCK: the timestamp of the newest
# assistant usage record in the session's MAIN transcript (FileFacts.context_ts). A
# usage record is a COMPLETED model round-trip, which is the one thing that cannot
# happen while the operator is still being waited on - the model is blocked. So:
#   - it never fires early. A standing question writes no usage record, ever.
#   - it fires for every answer path, because they all end in the model being called
#     again: an approved tool's result, a denied tool's result, a picked option, a
#     typed prompt (which UserPromptSubmit clears first anyway).
#   - it costs NOTHING new on the wire. crabd already parses these records for burn and
#     contextTokens; this reads a number that was already there.
# SUBAGENT files are deliberately excluded (see _blank_session's turn_ts): a background
# subagent finishing its own work while the main session waits is not an answer, and
# aggregating its records would clear a question that genuinely still stands.
#
# REJECTED, and why - both would close the same gap and neither earns its cost:
#   - PreToolUse/PostToolUse as activity pings. Precise, but they put an HTTP round trip
#     in front of EVERY tool call in every session: the highest-frequency hook surface
#     the product could have, on a host whose loopback drops SYN-ACKs. The transcript
#     already carries the same evidence on a path crabd polls anyway.
#   - OTLP activity. MEASURED in this repo, not assumed: setup/*.ps1 sets no OTEL_*
#     variable, so a default install emits no OTLP at all - a clearing signal that is
#     absent on the maintainer's machine is not a fix. And crabd maps OTLP_SESSION_ATTR at exactly
#     ONE site (OtlpReceiver.ingest_logs, `api_error` events); cost metric points are
#     keyed by attribute-set string and never resolved to a session, so per-session
#     "token activity" does not exist here. note_external's docstring already forbids
#     telemetry moving the state machine, and an api_error is evidence of a FAILING

# GET /v1/state about 2 s after crabd started raised out of the do_GET branch, and the

# not reproduce it, so the fix is not "the one line that threw" - it is the three seams
# that could produce it, each closed so the honest-failure rule holds by construction:
# a data shape crabd cannot read is SKIPPED and logged, never served as a 500.

# parser outright - a non-dict `message` or `usage`, a usage counter that is a dict, a
# list, a string, an Infinity or a NaN. Any ONE of them anywhere under ~/.claude/projects
# aborted store.scan() and therefore the WHOLE build, so a single unreadable line in one
# session's transcript took every session's card down with it. The fixtures cover none of
# these shapes, which is exactly what "a shape the fixtures don't cover" means.
#
# The transition IS ordinary and it IS bounded: a skipped record is skipped for good (the

        `at` is the timestamp of the newest completed model round-trip in this session's
        MAIN transcript (see the NEEDS_INPUT_* constant block for why that is the signal
        and what was rejected in its place). A round-trip strictly after the question was
        raised can only mean the model was unblocked, so this is a REAL transition and is
        written as one: `question` cleared, `acked` cleared, `since` moved, a ring event
        persisted like any hook's.

        Writing it back rather than overlaying it in the served row is the whole point.
        An overlay would leave the tracker on `needs_input`, and the NEXT Notification
        would then find `row["state"] != state` false - so `since` would not move and
        `acked` would not clear. The second question of a turn would land pre-silenced on
        a card that had already escalated to red. A view-only fix trades one stuck alert
        for a missed one.

        Only ever moves needs_input -> working. Every other state ignores it, which is

            for one session race in the wild, and without the refusal the later of the two

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------- platform
#
# Everything crabd knows about the OS it is running on, behind ONE interface with three
# implementations. The readers above and below (HostSampler, FleetReader, LimitsReader)
# each take a `platform=` and default to PLATFORM, so none of them contains an OS test:
# they own their arithmetic and their honest-failure rules, the platform owns the
# syscall. A reader that reaches for the Win32 DLLs or `schtasks` directly is the bug
# this section exists to prevent - it is unreachable, and therefore untested, on the
# host most of this suite runs on.
#
# The three classes are INTERCHANGEABLE by contract, pinned by tests that compare their
# public method sets, signatures and binding. Adding a method to one alone ships an
# AttributeError to every other OS, in a daemon whose one promise is to keep serving.
#
# `cpu_times` and `memory` are INSTANCE methods on all three (everything else is static)
# because the macOS CPU reader keeps state: the mach tick counters are 32-bit and wrap,
# and unwrapping them needs the last raw reading per bucket. The other two classes carry
# no state and would be happy as staticmethods - they are instance methods anyway so the
# binding stays identical across the three, which is the seam's whole promise and is
# pinned by a test. PLATFORM is a module singleton, so the accumulators live as long as
# the process; a reader that built a fresh DarwinPlatform per sample would lose them.
#
# A platform with no service manager RAISES out of service_query rather than returning
# None: the caller unpacks the result, so a bare None would be a TypeError past
# FleetReader's catch list - a crash where an `unknown` belongs.
#
# The one deliberate non-raise is FLEET_NO_SERVICE, `(None, "", "")`: a component the
# platform NAMES but has no service for at all (macOS glow, since there is no lighting
# component there). It unpacks like any other answer, and the None CODE - which no
# process can exit with - is what service_status reads as `absent`. FleetReader
# short-circuits an empty target onto that sentinel before any runner is called, so a
# platform whose targets are ALL empty never reaches its own service_query at all.

    A chained statusline command posts Claude Code's own stdin document here. Three
    facts are taken from it and nothing else is kept: the rate-limit windows (which
    become `limits`, tagged source "statusline"), how full the session's context window
    is (which becomes that row's contextTokens, tagged contextSource "statusline") and,
    since v0.28.0, how BIG that window is (which becomes contextWindowTokens - the
    denominator the first number fills toward). Everything else in the document - cost,
    prompts, workspace paths, pr identity - is read past. A status line fires on every
    keystroke-ish event; this object is on that path and must stay a dict write.

    Nothing here ever renders a zero for an absent number. `rate_limits` is missing
    entirely on API-key/Bedrock/Vertex sessions and before a session's first API
    response, and that is the normal case, not an error: the reader simply keeps no
    limits and `limits()` returns None, which is the builder's cue to fall back to the

    CPU IS A DELTA, AND THAT IS THE ONLY HARD THING IN HERE. GetSystemTimes returns
    three CUMULATIVE FILETIMEs (idle, kernel, user) counted since boot, so one reading
    describes the whole uptime and says nothing about now - utilization exists only
    BETWEEN two readings. Two consequences, both pinned by tests:

      - the FIRST sample has no predecessor, so `cpuPct` is null until the next builder
        pass (~2 s). Null, never 0.0: "not measured yet" and "the machine is asleep"
        are different claims and only one of them is true at startup.
      - KERNEL TIME INCLUDES IDLE TIME. Microsoft documents it and it is the classic
        way to get this wrong. The busy fraction is
            ((kernel + user) - idle) / (kernel + user)
        over the deltas; drop the subtraction and a completely idle host reports ~100%
        busy, which is a gauge that is not merely imprecise but inverted.

    Memory is a single instantaneous reading (GlobalMemoryStatusEx), needs no history,
    and is therefore served on the very first pass.

    HONEST FAILURE, in three tiers, because "cannot read" has three different shapes:
      - no counters at all (a platform whose reader answers None, or both calls failing)
        -> NO `host` key in the document. The widget feature-detects presence, so it
        renders nothing rather than a row of em-dashes.
      - one of the two calls failing -> that call's fields null, the other's intact.
      - a reading that is not a finite number -> null, via `_pct` / `_gb`.
    A previous pass's number is NEVER re-served as though it were fresh: there is no
    last-good cache in here at all, which is the whole reason `cpuPct` can be null on a
    running daemon.

    The lock guards `_prev` only, and it is not decorative: at cold start `_do_state`
    builds ON THE REQUEST THREAD while `_refresh_loop` is building its first snapshot,
    so two samples really can overlap. Unlocked, both would read the same `_prev`,
    both would report a delta measured from it, and the later write would win - two
    overlapping windows served as if they were consecutive.

    is which input events iCUE actually delivers to the glass: a TAP is proven (panel
    approvals were verified live on 2026-08-27), while swipe, long-press and multi-touch
    are unknown. The only way to find out is for the widget to say what it saw, over the
    same loopback port everything else already rides, and for a maintainer to read it.

    IN MEMORY ONLY, AND THAT IS A DECISION, not an omission. Nothing here touches disk
    and nothing survives a crabd restart. This is a scratch channel for a live debugging
    session, not history: persisting free text the widget composes would create a file
    that grows, that backups pick up, and that somebody later reads as a record of what
    happened. `droppedTotal` exists precisely so a reader can tell they are looking at a

    verbatim, and NOTHING in this daemon reads them back into any decision path - not the
    state build, not the permission broker, not the continue queue, not a config write.

    of the content: this ring has exactly one reader (the GET below) and it hands the
    bytes to a human. Any future caller that parses a line in here is the change that
    breaks the property, so it is the change to refuse.

    Bounded by the ring alone - no rate limit, by design. The worst legal body (50 lines

    DIAGNOSTIC ONLY. This feeds GET /v1/health.originsSeen and NOTHING else - it is never
    a `build()` input, never in /v1/state, and never read back into a decision path. Its
    single purpose is to let a maintainer read what Origin the real QtWebEngine widget sends
    from its live polling, which is the measurement the SEC-a allowlist fix is blocked on.

    v0.27.0 - keyed on the DISTINCT (origin, source) PAIR, not origin alone. Several local
    sources send no Origin (the notifier, curl health checks, possibly the widget), so
    origin-only keying collapsed them into one uninformative "<absent>" bucket. `source` is
    a coarse bucket derived from the User-Agent (_classify_ua_source): "browser" | "local"
    | "none". Now `null`-from-a-browser and `<absent>`-from-a-local-process are SEPARATE
    rows - which is the entire point, because it is what isolates the widget.

    ⚠ `source` is DIAGNOSTIC ONLY and derived from an ATTACKER-CONTROLLED User-Agent. It
    NEVER feeds _is_web_origin or any gate - the CSRF gate stays origin-based, unchanged.
    This recorder only MEASURES; it does not enforce. A future SEC-a fix that keys the GATE
    on "absent vs null" (the clean discriminator IF the widget proves to send absent, not
    null) is a SEPARATE, deliberate change to _is_web_origin - not something this recorder
    does or licenses.

    LRU-BOUNDED at ORIGIN_RECORDER_MAX distinct pairs: the recorder sits on the
    unauthenticated request path, so requests with random forged Origins (or UAs) could
    otherwise grow it without bound. A repeat pair bumps its count and refreshes its slot;
    a NEW pair past the cap evicts the least-recently-seen one. Absent Origin is folded to
    the literal ORIGIN_ABSENT so "no header" is itself a countable value. The raw UA is kept
    (truncated to ORIGIN_UA_MAX) per entry as evidence of which build is polling.

        (measured 2026-08-28: "claude-fable-5", "claude-opus-5"), so no ctx-fill bar ever
        rendered on a real session.

        THREE sources, MOST SPECIFIC FIRST, and that ordering is the whole design:

          1. the status line's `context_window_size` - the CLI stating the window for
             THIS session, on the same freshness contest contextTokens takes;
          2. the model string's own marker - also session-specific (the CLI writes the
             marker for the window that session is running) and also stated by the feed;
          3. the model catalog's max_input_tokens - true of the MODEL, not of the
             session, so it is the last word and not the first.

        Rank 2 above rank 3 is not cosmetic. A served "claude-sonnet-4-6[200k]" against a
        catalog that reports 1000000 for claude-sonnet-4-6 is precisely the case: the
        marker is that session's window and the catalog is the model's ceiling, and
        preferring the ceiling would gauge the card at a fifth of its real fill - a bar
        that is wrong while looking exactly like one that is right. It also keeps the
        widget's own precedence honest: the served member wins there, so the server has
        to be the one that already honoured the marker.

        (a browser serialises an opaque origin as `null` and nothing else), so unlocking
        the header for a non-web scheme hands it to something a visited page cannot
        claim to be.

        THE ACCEPTED TRADE, stated rather than hidden: that measurement is one reading on
        one iCUE build. A build that reports `null` instead keeps its reads and loses its
        taps - the same shape as the 0.29.0 `decide` change, and safe for the same
        reason, since every write it makes has a terminal-side fallback. Widening `null`
        to close that would re-open the forged-null write for every browser on the
