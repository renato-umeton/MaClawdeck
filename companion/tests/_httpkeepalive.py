"""A keep-alive HTTP client for the crabd test suites.

WHY THIS EXISTS - measured 2026-08-26, and it is the whole reason the suite could not
reproduce its own result.

Every socket-based test used `urllib.request.urlopen`, which opens a FRESH TCP
connection per request and closes it. On Windows that is expensive in a way that has
nothing to do with speed: ephemeral ports are handed out from a single SEQUENTIAL
cursor spanning 1024-65535, and the side that closes first holds its port in TIME_WAIT.
Run a few thousand short connections and the cursor wraps into 4-tuples that are still
in TIME_WAIT; the kernel silently DROPS the SYN, the client retransmits (~0.5 s, 1.5 s,
3 s, 6 s...), and a request that normally takes 1 ms takes six seconds or times out.

That is exactly the failure the suite kept producing: `TimeoutError` inside
`sock.connect()`, on a different test every run, at a rate of roughly one per few
hundred connections. Not a defect in crabd, and not fixable by retrying the test.

Measured, three variants, same work (80 servers, 320 requests):

    new server per iter + new connection per request : 12 stalls   101.3 s
    new server per iter + ONE keep-alive connection  :  0 stalls    41.1 s
    ONE server          + ONE keep-alive connection  :  0 stalls     0.7 s

So the lever is the CONNECTION COUNT, not the server count - churning 80 servers with
keep-alive was perfectly clean. Reusing the connection is also what every real client of
crabd does: the widget polls, the status line command posts on a debounce, and crabd has
advertised HTTP/1.1 keep-alive since v0.1.

One connection per THREAD, because the permission long-poll tests deliberately fire
concurrent requests and a single http.client connection is not shareable.

THE RESIDUAL, and what it actually is
-------------------------------------
Keep-alive cuts the exposure by ~5x but does not remove it, because the rest is not
OURS. Caught in the act on 2026-08-26 - netstat taken at the instant a connect timed
out, against a server whose own process was idle:

    port LISTENING  = True                     threads_alive = 2
    TCP  127.0.0.1:54560   127.0.0.1:1151    SYN_RECEIVED
    TCP  127.0.0.1:54560   127.0.0.1:56570   SYN_RECEIVED
    TCP  127.0.0.1:54560   127.0.0.1:56579   SYN_RECEIVED
    TCP  127.0.0.1:54560   127.0.0.1:58057   SYN_RECEIVED

The listening socket is healthy, the accept backlog is 128, the process has two threads
and is doing nothing - and four separate connections are stuck half-open because the
SYN-ACK never completes. On LOOPBACK. Nothing in Python can make a dropped SYN-ACK
arrive; the application is not a participant in a handshake that never finishes.

It reproduces with urllib and with http.client, with the accept backlog at 5 and at 128,
inside unittest and in a bare loop with no test framework at all, against a server
churned every iteration and against one that listened untouched for the whole run. It
arrives in WINDOWS lasting seconds to tens of seconds and clears on its own. On this
workstation the TCP dynamic port range is set to 1024-65535 rather than the Windows
default 49152-65535, so both ends draw ports from the whole registered range where
filter drivers hook - an endpoint security product inspecting new loopback flows is the
usual cause of exactly this signature.

Two things follow, and the harness does both:

  - `start_test_server()` below PROVES the port before a test runs, and re-binds
    somewhere else if it cannot. A poisoned port is then a fixture problem the fixture
    solves, not a failure attributed to whatever test drew it.
  - `connect()` - and ONLY connect() - is retried.

The retry is not a retry-until-green, and the distinction is the whole point: a SYN that
never gets a SYN-ACK never reaches the application, so crabd is not a participant in
what is being retried. The request, its status, its body and every timing assertion stay
exactly as strict as they were - `RETRYABLE` deliberately excludes TimeoutError, so a
request that hangs AFTER connecting still fails the test, which is the failure mode this
whole file exists to expose. Both mitigations are counted (`connect_retries`,
`ABANDONED_PORTS`) and printed at exit, so they are auditable rather than invisible, and
SIDECRAB_TEST_NO_CONNECT_RETRY=1 turns the retry off for anyone who wants to watch the
host misbehave directly.

Rejected alternative, recorded so it is not re-tried: closing the client socket with
SO_LINGER(1, 0) to avoid TIME_WAIT entirely. It does avoid TIME_WAIT, and it also sends
an RST that lands mid-handler and fills the server's stderr with ConnectionResetError
tracebacks. Measured 2026-08-26; not worth it.
