"""The two secrets macOS keeps in the login Keychain, and the seam crabd reads them
through.

They are two DIFFERENT problems and this file never conflates them:

  - `Claude Code-credentials` is the CLI's OWN credential. On this Mac (measured
    2026-09-04, Claude Code 2.1.260) `~/.claude/.credentials.json` does not exist at all
    and the login Keychain holds the item instead, so a crabd that only knows about the
    file reads "no Claude credentials" forever on an account that is perfectly logged in.
  - `SideCrab limits token` is SIDECRAB'S own store for a long-lived `claude setup-token`
    value - the macOS answer to `~/.sidecrab/limits-token.dpapi`, which is a DPAPI blob
    and therefore a Windows fact.

THE TOKENS ARE SECRETS, and the tests below are the enforcement: neither may appear in
`/v1/state`, `/v1/health`, a log line, an exception message or a process argument list.
`ps` is world-readable on macOS, so a secret in argv is a secret handed to every user on
the machine - which is why the store command travels on `security -i`'s STDIN and only
the reads (which carry no secret at all) use an argv.

Every test here is pure and runs on any OS: `/usr/bin/security` is behind an injected
seam, and the module kill switch `KEYCHAIN_CREDENTIALS_ENABLED` is set False for the
whole module so nothing can reach the operator's real Keychain by accident. The one
exception is the live test at the bottom, which is opt-in and says why.
