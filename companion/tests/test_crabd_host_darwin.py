"""`host` on macOS: the mach counters, and the arithmetic that hands them to HostSampler.

HostSampler is not changed by this file and must not be: its rules (kernel INCLUDES
idle, the first sample has no delta, CPU_MIN_TOTAL_TICKS, the A-07/A-08/A-09 branches,
no last-good cache) were bought by measurement on Windows and are the contract's failure
table. What is new is a reader that speaks mach and answers in the sampler's units, so
everything below is about the ADAPTER: the tuple convention, the 32-bit unwrap, and the
Activity Monitor memory formula.

Every test here is pure and runs on any OS - the kernel is behind injected seams - except
the two at the bottom that are the healthy-night check against a real Mac.
