"""The two transport gates in front of the panel: which ORIGIN may talk to crabd, and
the header every POST has to carry.

Until 0.31.0 the origin rule was one predicate - a present http(s) Origin is a visited
web page, refuse it - and that was right while the panel was an iCUE widget served from
disk, whose own Origin serialises to `null`. crabd now serves the panel itself, so the
panel HAS a real web origin (`http://localhost:<port>`), and "refuse every http origin"
would refuse the product. The allowlist is the case the old docstring anticipated: a
panel build with a stable origin, allowlisted to that exact value.

The allowlist alone would not be enough. `null` still has to be allowed - the iCUE build
legitimately sends it and a sandboxed iframe can forge it - so a forged-null page would
inherit every write path. The header gate is what closes that: a custom request header
turns a CORS-simple POST into a preflighted one, and the preflight only unlocks
`X-SideCrab-Panel` for a panel origin or a non-web scheme, never for `null`. The two
gates are therefore proven SEPARATELY here; either one alone leaves a hole.
