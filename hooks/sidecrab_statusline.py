"""SideCrab statusLine ingest — the chained status line command.

Claude Code runs this on every status-line refresh, piping the official status-line
document to stdin and rendering whatever this prints to stdout. Wired by
``setup\\Install-SideCrab.ps1`` into ``~/.claude/settings.json``::

    "statusLine": { "type": "command",
                    "command": "\\"<python.exe>\\" \\"<repo>\\hooks\\sidecrab_statusline.py\\"" }

Two jobs, in this order, and the SECOND must never be starved by the first:

1. POST the stdin document verbatim to crabd's ``/v1/statusline`` (fire-and-forget,
   sub-half-second timeout). crabd prefers this over the OAuth reach-around for limits +
   per-session context (docs\\STATE-CONTRACT.md, "v0.12.0 additions" item 1). A stopped or
   slow crabd must NEVER delay or break the prompt, so the POST is wrapped and capped hard.

2. CHAIN: if the installer saved a pre-existing status-line command (because the operator
   already had one before SideCrab took the slot), run it with the SAME stdin and pass its
   stdout straight through — the user keeps the status line they had. If none was saved,
   print a minimal SideCrab line built from the document, or nothing.

VERIFIED AGAINST THE SHIPPED CLAUDE CODE (claude.exe v2.1.246, 2026-08-26):
  - The status-line config accepts ONLY ``type:"command"`` (a ``type`` other than
    "command" is ignored); optional ``padding``/``refreshInterval`` are honoured.
  - The command receives a JSON document on stdin whose top-level keys include
    ``session_id``, ``model:{id,display_name}``, ``workspace:{current_dir,project_dir,
    added_dirs,...}``, ``version`` and cost/limit blocks. This script does not depend on
    any single field — it forwards the bytes to crabd untouched and only reads
    ``model``/``workspace`` for the minimal fallback line.
  Source: docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks (status line) and the shipped binary
  (``statusLine:{type:literal("command"),command,padding?,refreshInterval?}`` schema).

Zero dependencies beyond the stdlib. Silent by construction: any failure degrades to the
next tier (chain -> minimal -> nothing); a status-line command that raised would smear a
traceback across the terminal on every refresh.

#: crabd's status-line ingest. Fire-and-forget: crabd answers 204 and never sends a body
#: this cares about. Fixed localhost endpoint, same as every other SideCrab client.
STATUSLINE_ENDPOINT = "http://127.0.0.1:9999/v1/statusline"

#: crabd 0.31.0 and later refuses any POST that does not carry this header, with 403
#: "panel header required". Any non-empty value passes; "1" is what every SideCrab client
#: sends. An older crabd ignores it, so sending it always is safe in both directions.
PANEL_HEADER = "X-SideCrab-Panel"

#: Hard cap on the POST. The status line re-renders often and blocks the prompt while this
#: process runs, so a stopped-but-listening crabd (or a firewall black-hole) must not cost
#: the user more than this. A refused connection fails in microseconds; this only bounds the
#: pathological "accepts then hangs" case. Kept well under the half-second the contract asks.
